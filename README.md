# hello-world
Hi, my name is Gregory Williams, I am a 29-year-old father of two, I spent the first 12 years of my life in Western New York, but have lived in Kentucky ever since. 
I currently work in Automotive Manufacturing but have always had a passion for computers and video games.
I am excited to be starting this class, and hopefully taking the first step on a long journey into a preferred lifestyle.
